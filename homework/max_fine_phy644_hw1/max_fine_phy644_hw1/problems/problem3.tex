\section*{Problem 3: Surface Brightness}

Ah this is a classic, and counter intuitive derivation in any atmospheres \& radiative transfers class.  (Which I have taken). The answer is that there is a $1/r^2$ factor from the flux, there is also a factor in angular size  which precisely cancel. 

I'm gonna do the full derivation + a diagram because I enjoy this problem. 

the specific surface brightness is the energy emitted per unit time per unit area per unit frequency per unit solid angle.
